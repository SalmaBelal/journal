# Why Engineering Feels So Stressful And Why Software Careers Often Lack Mentorship

Engineering students and junior software developers often share a similar feeling:

> “Why does this feel so hard — and why does it feel like I’m figuring it out alone?”

If you compare this to medicine — a field built around structured supervision and apprenticeship — the difference becomes striking. Medicine is deeply mentorship-based. Software engineering often isn’t.

This structural difference explains a lot about both the stress of engineering degrees and the “thrown into the fire” experience many junior developers describe.

Let’s unpack why.

---

## Medicine Is Built on Apprenticeship. Software Isn’t.

In medicine, mentorship is not optional — it’s institutional.

* You cannot practice independently without supervised training.
* There’s a formal ladder: medical student → resident → fellow → attending.
* Senior doctors are explicitly responsible for training juniors.
* Patient safety legally requires supervision.

Mentorship is baked into the system.

Software engineering operates differently:

* There is no licensing requirement.
* Anyone can be hired as a developer.
* Companies optimize for shipping products, not training pipelines.
* Teaching juniors is often informal and unmeasured.

In medicine, supervision is mandatory.
In software, mentorship is cultural — and culture varies widely.

## Why Engineering Degrees Are So Stressful

The stress of engineering university programs mirrors the structure of the industry. Several forces combine:

### 1. High Cognitive Load

Engineering programs demand:

* Advanced mathematics
* Abstract thinking
* Systems-level reasoning
* Real implementation under constraints

You’re constantly switching between theory and application, details and big-picture systems. That cognitive shifting is exhausting.

Medicine can be intense, but early training is more memorization-heavy. Engineering is abstraction-heavy — and abstraction consumes more mental energy.

---

### 2. “Figure It Out” Is the Default Mode

Engineering education often assumes productive struggle is part of the process.

Professors may:

* Give ambiguous project specs
* Provide minimal scaffolding
* Expect independent debugging
* Grade primarily on output

You’re expected to teach yourself how to think through problems.

That mirrors software culture in industry.

You are being conditioned early to operate without constant supervision.

---

### 3. Binary Feedback Loops

Engineering assignments often feel all-or-nothing:

* It compiles or it doesn’t.
* Tests pass or they fail.
* The system works or it breaks.

That creates intense visibility around competence.

There’s less emotional cushioning than in fields where progress is more gradual or qualitative. When something fails, it can feel like *you* failed.

---

### 4. Identity Pressure

Engineering attracts analytical, high-achieving people.

When you struggle, it can hit your sense of intelligence:

> “If I’m logical, why can’t I solve this?”

Medicine explicitly frames early training as apprenticeship. You are expected to be inexperienced.

Engineering implicitly assumes capability from the start.

That gap between expectation and experience creates stress.

---

## Why Juniors in Software Often Feel “Thrown In”

When graduates enter industry, they encounter another shock.

There is rarely a mandated mentorship structure.

Common realities:

* Seniors are overloaded.
* Delivery timelines take priority.
* Mentorship slows output.
* Teaching is not always incentivized.

This leads to environments where junior developers:

* Are given tickets quickly.
* Must navigate large codebases independently.
* Rely heavily on documentation and trial-and-error.
* Feel unsure whether they’re growing “correctly.”

It’s not always malicious neglect.

It’s structural.

Software assumes you will become ready by struggling.
Medicine assumes you are not ready and must be supervised.

That philosophical difference changes everything.

## Red Flags: When It’s Not Growth — It’s Neglect

There’s a crucial distinction between productive autonomy and unhealthy environments.

Early independence can build skill.
But some environments are genuinely harmful.

Here are red flags to watch for:

### 🚩 1. Hostility Toward Questions

* Seniors respond with irritation or sarcasm.
* You’re told to “just Google it” dismissively.
* Asking for clarification is subtly discouraged.

Curiosity should never be punished.

---

### 🚩 2. No Code Review Culture

* Pull requests are rubber-stamped.
* Feedback is minimal or nonexistent.
* There are no discussions about architecture or design.

Code review is one of the few natural mentorship channels in software. If it’s absent, growth stalls.

---

### 🚩 3. Zero Onboarding Structure

* No documentation.
* No clear expectations for the first 30–90 days.
* You’re given production-critical tasks immediately without context.

Autonomy is good. Chaos is not.

---

### 🚩 4. Chronic Firefighting

* Constant emergencies.
* No time for refactoring or learning.
* Every sprint feels reactive.

In these environments, survival replaces skill development.

---

### 🚩 5. No Feedback, Ever

* No growth conversations.
* No clarity on performance.
* You have no idea if you’re doing well.

Uncertainty without feedback erodes confidence over time.

---

### 🚩 6. Seniors Hoard Knowledge

* Key systems are “owned” by one person.
* Documentation is intentionally thin.
* Explanations are withheld.

Healthy teams distribute knowledge. Dysfunctional teams centralize it.

---

If multiple red flags are present, the solution isn’t “be tougher.”

It may be:

> Gain experience strategically and move to a healthier team.

Environment matters more than grit.

---

## The Hidden Trade-Off

This isn’t purely negative.

The same lack of rigid structure in software also creates:

* Faster autonomy
* Earlier ownership
* Creative freedom
* Multiple valid solution paths

Medicine provides safety through hierarchy.
Software provides flexibility through autonomy.

Early on, autonomy feels destabilizing.
Later, it becomes empowering.

---

## The Real Stressor: Isolation, Not Difficulty

Often, the hardest part of engineering isn’t the workload.

It’s the emotional experience of being alone with hard problems.

When there’s no built-in scaffolding:

* You don’t know if you’re behind.
* You don’t know if you’re overcomplicating.
* You don’t know what “good” looks like.
* You don’t know whether your confusion is normal.

Medicine institutionalizes reassurance through supervision.
Software requires you to seek reassurance proactively.

That’s a skill — but it’s rarely taught explicitly.

---

## How to Navigate This Reality

The goal isn’t to eliminate difficulty. It’s to change how you interact with it.

### Engineer Your Own Mentorship

* Ask scoped, specific questions.
* Use code reviews as learning sessions.
* Find someone slightly ahead of you — accessible, not mythical.
* Schedule short, recurring check-ins if possible.

Make it easy for others to help you.

---

### Create Your Own Structure

Since the system doesn’t enforce milestones, build your own:

* “This quarter, I’ll deeply understand our deployment pipeline.”
* “I will own one feature end-to-end.”
* “I will master testing patterns.”

Autonomy without structure feels chaotic.
Autonomy with structure feels powerful.

---

### Separate Discomfort from Neglect

Ask yourself:

* Am I stretching?
* Or am I unsupported?

Productive discomfort builds skill.
Chronic neglect erodes confidence.

Knowing the difference is critical.

---

### Choose Teams, Not Just Companies

Some teams are mentorship-rich.
Others are output-only.

In interviews, ask:

* “How do you onboard juniors?”
* “What does code review look like?”
* “How do engineers grow here?”

Their answers will reveal the culture.

---

## Final Thought

Engineering is stressful not because you’re incapable — but because the field is structured around early autonomy rather than structured apprenticeship.

Medicine guarantees guidance.
Software rewards self-direction.

That difference can feel harsh at first.

But once you learn how to build your own scaffolding — how to extract mentorship, create structure, and tolerate ambiguity — you develop a level of independence that becomes a long-term advantage.

The challenge isn’t just learning to code.

It’s learning to grow without being held the whole way.

And that’s a different kind of skill entirely.
